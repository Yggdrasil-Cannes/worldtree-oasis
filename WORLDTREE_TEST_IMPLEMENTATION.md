# ROFL Worldtree Test Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Created

### 1. WorldtreeTest Contract (`/contracts/contracts/WorldtreeTest.sol`)
- **Purpose**: Test version of Worldtree that accepts direct SNP data instead of Walrus CIDs
- **Key Features**:
  - Users register with raw SNP data strings
  - Request genetic analysis between any two registered users
  - ROFL app polls for pending requests
  - ROFL app retrieves SNP data and submits analysis results
  - Automatic relationship creation for confidence >= 50%

### 2. Enhanced ROFL Python Service (`/services/llm-api/main_worldtree_test.py`)
- **Purpose**: Poll WorldtreeTest contract and process genetic analysis requests
- **Key Features**:
  - Proper ABI encoding/decoding for contract calls
  - Polls contract every 30 seconds for pending requests
  - Retrieves SNP data from contract
  - Runs PCA genetic analysis
  - Submits results back to contract
  - Provides LLM tips for family reconnection

### 3. ABI Encoder Module (`/services/llm-api/abi_encoder.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handle Ethereum ABI encoding/decoding for ROFL authenticated transactions
- **Functions Supported**:
  - `getPendingRequests()`
  - `getSNPDataForAnalysis(uint256)`
  - `submitAnalysisResult(uint256,string,uint256,string)`
  - `markAnalysisFailed(uint256,string)`

### 4. Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-worldtree-test.js`: Deploy the WorldtreeTest contract
- `test-worldtree.js`: Interactive test script that:
  - Registers two test users with generated SNP data
  - Requests genetic analysis
  - Monitors for results
  - Displays relationship findings

### 5. Docker Configuration
- `Dockerfile.test`: Updated to include all new modules
- Updated `requirements.txt` with eth-abi and eth-utils

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. WorldtreeTest contract created and ready for deployment
2. ROFL Python service enhanced with proper polling mechanism
3. ABI encoding/decoding implemented
4. Test scripts created
5. Docker configuration updated

### ❌ Not Yet Completed
1. **WorldtreeTest contract NOT deployed** - needs to be deployed to Sapphire Testnet
2. **ROFL app NOT updated** - the bundle needs to be rebuilt and deployed with new code
3. **Docker image NOT pushed** - needs to be built and pushed with test version
4. **Integration NOT tested** - full end-to-end test pending

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. ROFL Socket API Format
The handover mentioned uncertainty about eth_call format. Based on research, the ROFL socket API appears to use standard JSON-RPC format:
```json
{
  "method": "eth_call",
  "params": [{
    "to": "0xcontractAddress",
    "data": "0xABIEncodedData"
  }, "latest"]
}
```

However, this needs verification as the endpoint might be different from what's implemented.

### 2. Missing eth_call Endpoint
The current implementation assumes `/rofl/v1/eth/call` endpoint exists, but this is NOT confirmed in the documentation. The only confirmed endpoint is `/rofl/v1/tx/sign-submit` for authenticated transactions.

### 3. View Function Calls
There's uncertainty about how to call view functions (like `getPendingRequests`) from within ROFL. The current implementation might need adjustment.

## Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Deploy WorldtreeTest Contract
```bash
cd /Users/pc/projects/worldtree/rofl/contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-worldtree-test.js --network sapphire-testnet
```
Note the deployed address!

### 2. Build and Push Docker Image
```bash
cd /Users/pc/projects/worldtree/rofl/services/llm-api
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t cyama/llm-api:test .
docker push cyama/llm-api:test
```
Note the SHA256 digest!

### 3. Update compose.yaml
```yaml
services:
  llm-api:
    image: docker.io/cyama/llm-api:test@sha256:NEW_SHA_HERE
    environment:
      - WORLDTREE_CONTRACT=DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE
```

### 4. Rebuild and Deploy ROFL
```bash
cd /Users/pc/projects/worldtree/rofl
# Build
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -v .:/src ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/rofl-dev:main oasis rofl build

# Update (MUST sign transaction)
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -v .:/src -v ~/Library/Application\ Support/oasis:/root/.config/oasis ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/rofl-dev:main oasis rofl update

# Deploy
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -v .:/src -v ~/Library/Application\ Support/oasis:/root/.config/oasis ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/rofl-dev:main oasis rofl deploy
```

### 5. Test the System
```bash
cd /Users/pc/projects/worldtree/rofl/contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/test-worldtree.js DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network sapphire-testnet
```

### 6. Monitor Logs
```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -v .:/src -v ~/Library/Application\ Support/oasis:/root/.config/oasis ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/rofl-dev:main oasis rofl machine logs
```

## Potential Issues to Fix

### 1. eth_call Implementation
If `/rofl/v1/eth/call` doesn't exist, you'll need to modify the code to either:
- Use authenticated transactions for everything (expensive)
- Find the correct endpoint for view functions
- Implement a different polling mechanism

### 2. Gas Optimization
The current implementation polls every 30 seconds, which might be too frequent. Consider:
- Increasing poll interval to reduce load
- Implementing exponential backoff
- Using events if supported

### 3. Error Handling
The current implementation logs errors but might benefit from:
- Retry logic for failed transactions
- Better error categorization
- Alerting mechanism for critical failures

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start with Manual Contract Testing**
   - Deploy contract
   - Manually register users using Hardhat console
   - Create analysis request
   - Verify ROFL can see pending requests

2. **Test Individual Components**
   - Test ABI encoding separately
   - Test SNP analyzer with real data
   - Test ROFL socket connectivity

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Use the provided test script
   - Monitor both contract events and ROFL logs
   - Verify genetic analysis results make sense

## Security Considerations

1. **SNP Data Privacy**
   - Currently stored unencrypted in contract (for testing only)
   - Production version should use encryption
   - Consider access controls for who can request analysis

2. **ROFL Authentication**
   - Ensure only authorized ROFL app can submit results
   - The contract uses `Subcall.roflEnsureAuthorizedOrigin`

3. **Input Validation**
   - Validate SNP data format
   - Check for malicious inputs
   - Limit data sizes

## Conclusion

The test implementation is ready but needs deployment and testing. The main uncertainty is around the ROFL socket API format for view function calls. Once deployed, the system should allow testing of the genetic analysis pipeline without Walrus integration.
